// question 12 - done here
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var Names = ["umer", "john", "sara", "ali", "khan", "aliya"];
// array index always starts from zero 0
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[0] + ", have you completed your homework?");
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[1] + ", have you completed your homework?");
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[2] + ", have you completed your homework?");
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[3] + ", have you completed your homework?");
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[4] + ", have you completed your homework?");
console.log("assalam alikum! " + Names[5] + ", have you completed your homework?");
